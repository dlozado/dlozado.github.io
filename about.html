            <section class="about-section">
                <p>I am a 10th-grade student at The Browning School, where I have been since 9th grade. I grew up and live in Queens, NYC. I am fully Ecuadorian, though I was born in New York City. I am the son of immigrant parents who came to New York City around 25 years ago. I have an older brother who is currently in college.</p>

                <h2>Interests & Goals</h2>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, designing clothes, playing baseball, soccer, and other sports. In the future, I would like to work for a major finance firm. But my dream is to own a big clothing brand.</p>
