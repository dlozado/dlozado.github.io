        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I am a 10th-grade student at The Browning School, where I have been
            since 9th grade. I grew up and currently live in Queens, New York City.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am fully Ecuadorian, though I was born in New York City. I am the
            son of immigrant parents who came to New York City around 25 years
            ago. I also have an older brother who is currently in college.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, designing clothes,
            and playing sports such as baseball and soccer.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the future, I would like to work for a major finance firm.
            However, my ultimate dream is to own a large and successful
            clothing brand.
